<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
Brian Lee

<h2>Project Title</h2>
Travel Scheduler

<h2>What and Why?</h2>
Traveling far away from home is exciting but the planning can be burdensome. While creating a list of places that travelers wish to visit is quite simple, it becomes very complex taking into account the most efficient routes in between each place, especially since different cities and countries have different transportation methods and layouts. Hence, the Travel Scheduler would help its users to visually create and configure their routes for a day or the whole trip. By having a visual schedule of the day, travelers can worry less about how to get to each destination and enjoy their vacation.

<h2>For Whom?</h2>

Travel Scheduler could be targeted to anyone traveling internationally or domestically. As the application intends to use Google Maps API for mapping, the only limitation would be if the destination is supported by Google Maps.

<h2>How?</h2>
<li>Authorization for privacy of information and invite other authorized users to trip to share information</li>
<li>Search POI (Point of Interest) using Google Maps API and enable to bookmark and store data in DB</li>
<li>Create route between POI and link them together to create a day or whole trip's schedule</li>
<li>Send notification or email for finalized schedule to the user on the day of the trip</li>

<h2>Scope</h2>
While using Google Maps API can sound a lot, the usage in this application would be simply making fetch requests and creating a basic overlay on the existing map as configured by the user.
</br>
The backend would require authorization setup as well as a database to store user search data.
Google Maps API already has most of the functionalities (POI search, draw methods) built-in, so front-end would mostly be creating basic UI.

For a group of 4 to 6 people, this project could definitely be completed within the semester.
